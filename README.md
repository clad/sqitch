[Sqitch](https://sqitch.org/) is a database change management application. It
currently supports PostgreSQL 8.4+, SQLite 3.7.11+, MySQL 5.0+, Oracle 10g+,
Firebird 2.0+, Vertica 6.0+, Exasol 6.0+ and Snowflake.

What makes it different from your typical
[migration](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/migrations.html) approaches? A few
things:

*   No opinions

    Sqitch is not tied to any framework, ORM, or platform. Rather, it is a
    standalone change management system with no opinions about your database
    engine, application framework, or development environment.

*   Native scripting

    Changes are implemented as scripts native to your selected database
    engine. Writing a [PostgreSQL](https://postgresql.org/) application? Write
    SQL scripts for
    [`psql`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/app-psql.html).
    Writing an [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/database/)-backed app?
    Write SQL scripts for [SQL\*Plus](https://www.orafaq.com/wiki/SQL*Plus).

*   Dependency resolution

    Database changes may declare dependencies on other changes -- even on
    changes from other Sqitch projects. This ensures proper order of
    execution, even when you've committed changes to your VCS out-of-order.

*   Deployment integrity

    Sqitch manages changes and dependencies via a plan file, and employs a
    [Merkle tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree "Wikipedia: “Merkle tree”")
    pattern similar to
    [Git](https://stackoverflow.com/a/18589734/ "Stack Overflow: “What is the mathematical structure that represents a Git repo”")
    and [Blockchain](https://medium.com/byzantine-studio/blockchain-fundamentals-what-is-a-merkle-tree-d44c529391d7 "Medium: “Blockchain Fundamentals #1: What is a Merkle Tree?”")
    to ensure deployment integrity.
    As such, there is no need to number your changes, although you can if you
    want. Sqitch doesn't much care how you name your changes.

*   Iterative Development

    Up until you [tag](https://sqitch.org/docs/manual/sqitch-tag/) and
    [release](https://sqitch.org/docs/manual/sqitch-tag/) your project, you
    can modify your change deployment scripts as often as you like. They're
    not locked in just because they've been committed to your VCS. This allows
    you to take an iterative approach to developing your database schema. Or,
    better, you can do test-driven database development.

  Portland Perl Mongers in January, 2013.

  Slides from a three-hour tutorial session on using [Git](https://git-scm.org),
  test-driven development with [pgTAP](https://pgtap.org), and change

Installation
------------

To install Sqitch from a distribution download, type the following:

    perl Build.PL
    ./Build installdeps
    ./Build
    ./Build test
    ./Build install

To install Sqitch and all of its dependencies into a single directory named
`sqitch_bundle`, install the Menlo CPAN client and build the bundle:

    cpanm Menlo::CLI::Compat
    ./Build bundle --install_base sqitch_bundle

After which, Sqitch can be run from `./sqitch_bundle/bin/sqitch`. By default,
no modules that are included in the core Perl distrituion are included. To
require that dual-life modules also be bundled, pass `--dual_life 1`:

    ./Build bundle --install_base sqitch_bundle --dual_life 1

To include support for a feature in the bundle, pass the `--with` option
naming the feature:

    ./Build bundle --install_base sqitch_bundle --with postgres --with sqlite

The feature names generally correspond to the supported engines. The currently
supported features are:

*   `--with postgres`:  Support for managing PostgreSQL databases
*   `--with sqlite`:    Support for managing SQLite databases
*   `--with mysql`:     Support for managing MySQL databases
*   `--with firebird`:  Support for managing Firebird databases
*   `--with oracle`:    Support for managing Oracle databases
*   `--with vertica`:   Support for managing Vertica databases
*   `--with exasol`:    Support for managing Exasol databases
*   `--with snowflake`: Support for managing Snowflake databases
*   `--with odbc`:      Include the ODBC driver

To build from a Git clone, first install
[Dist::Zilla](https://metacpan.org/module/Dist::Zilla), then use it to install
Sqitch and all dependencies:

    cpanm Dist::Zilla
    dzil authordeps --missing | cpanm
    dzil listdeps --missing | cpanm
    dzil install

To run Sqitch directly from the Git clone, execute `t/sqitch`.

To install Sqitch on a specific platform, including Debian- and RedHat-derived
Linux distributions and Windows, see the
[Installation documentation](https://sqitch.org/#installation).
